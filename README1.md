Day 2: Learning parts that we'll use.
Here we researched the various parts that will be used throughout the course:
<html>
<head></head>
<body>
<ol>
<li>Resistor</li>
    <p>It is used to limit or regulate flow of electric current in a electric circuit.They don't have a positive or negative lead.There's a color code that enables us to calculate the resitance of the resisitor provided. In the link below you will find an article that explains this further:<a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-arduino-lesson-2-leds/resistors">More on resistors</a>
    </p>
<li>LED(Light Emitting Diode)</li>
    <p>An LED is a power-cheap lighting solution that comes in fun colors. Basically, it's a diode that emits light when current passes through it. To learn more,follow the link:<a href="https://electronics.howstuffworks.com/led.html">More on LEDs</a>
    </p>
<li>Bluetooth module</li>
    <p>A popular bluetooth module which can add two-way wireless functionality to your projects.To learn more,follow the link below:<a href="https://components101.com/wireless/hc-05-bluetooth-module">More on bluetooth modules</a>
    </p>
<li>LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)</li>
    <p>It is also called a photoresistor. They are electronic components that are used to detect light and change the operation of a circuit dependent upon the light levels.To learn more, follow the link:<a href="https://www.electronics-notes.com/articles/electronic_components/resistors/light-dependent-resistor-ldr.php">More on LDRs</a>
    </p>
<li>DHT sensor</li>
    <p>It is made of two parts: a capacitive humidity sensor and a thermistor. There is also a very basic chip inside that does some analog and digital conversion and spits out a digital signal with temperature and humidity. To learn more about sensors,follow the link:<a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/dht">More on sensors</a>
    </p>
<li>Breadboard</li>
    <p>A breadboard consists of plastic block holding a matrix of electrical sockets of a size suitable for gripping thin connecting wire, component wires or the pins of transistors and integrated circuits (ICs). To learn more,follow the link:<a href="https://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-fair-projects/references/how-to-use-a-breadboard">More on breadboard</a>
    </p>
<li>Pushbutton switch</li>
    <p>It connects two points in a circuit when you press them and completes it. To learn more, follow the link:<a href="https://uk.rs-online.com/web/generalDisplay.html?id=ideas-and-advice/push-button-switches-guide">More on pushbutton switch</a>
    </p>
<li>Buzzers</li>
    <p>A tiny speaker that you can connect directly to a board.To learn more,follow link:<a href="https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/SURYATEJA/use-a-buzzer-module-piezo-speaker-using-arduino-uno-89df45">More on buzzers</a>
